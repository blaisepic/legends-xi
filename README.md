A hefty work in progress. 

Goal: 
1) database of legends (pulled from fifa 21) and top players from previous fifas (I'm thinking fifa 05 and fifa 10)
2) build a team given a budget of 100m. The choice of players consists of the retired players and modern players. Players are priced according to their overall. This works nicely because the legends and the past fifas are rated very highly. The cheaper players will consist of today's players. This way everybody knows the role players on their team and won't be randomly selecting role players from 15 years ago.
3) clean, fantasy football esque GUI
4) once team has been selected, you get placed into Champions League football. The tourney is then simulated. 
5) The simulator will have to be basic at first and I will gradually upgrade it

This project uses:
1) Python for web-scraping (I am here)
2) Postgresql and pgAdmin for database management (might switch to MySQL, have to look into this once I've finished scraping)
3) HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React for building out the GUI
4) undecided choice of framework/language for the simulator, likely Python
