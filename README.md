# Legends XI

You are given 85m to build a squad from some of the most legendary football players that have graced the pitch. Your job is to build a dream-team of players from football's rich past while staying under budget. Once built, you get to simulate a match and see how your team performs.

This is a nostalgia-driven single-page application built with React JS. The express purpose of *Legends XI* was twofold:
* To take a stroll down memory lane. In years past, I was able to play FIFA without feeling the compulsion to throw my controller at the TV. Simpler times.
* To learn React and put my knowledge of it to the test. What better way to learn in this hyper-speed world of technology than to get right into the nitty gritty.

## Building a squad
Build your squad from roughly 100 of football's royalty, the best to have ever done it. The players and their stats have been sourced from Fifa â€” particularly, Fifa 21 and Fifa 05. Fifa 21 for its curated list of legends included in Ultimate Team, about 15 players. Fifa 05 for its abundance of legendary players in a period of footballing glory days. These are the days of Los Galacticos ran by Zidane, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raul, Figo, Beckham, and more. These are the days of Barcelona starring Ronaldinho, Deco, Puyol, Eto, and more. These are the days of Alessandro Nesta, Maldini, Cafu, Kaka, and Shevchenko leading the charge for AC Milan. Football was ripe with superstars, and Legends XI transports you back to managing a team in that era of football greatness.

## Close-up of the Goldtrotters
Here's a close-up of my squad of choice, a squad not without its trade-offs. But what my team lacks in (relative) big names, it makes up with consistency and world-class at every position.

## Languages, tools, and libraries:
1. Python for web-scraping data off of [FifaIndex.com](https://www.fifaindex.com/players/fifa05_1/?order_by=overallrating&order=0).
2. Postgresql and pgAdmin for database management. In a rush for time, I switched this to JSON for more straightforward integration with the front-end. If I could go back and do it again, this would be one area of prioritization.
3. HTML, CSS, and React for building out the GUI.
4. Git for version control.
