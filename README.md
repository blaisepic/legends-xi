# Legends XI

You are given 85m to build a squad from some of the most legendary football/soccer players that have graced the pitch. Your job is not merely to select the best players -- Pele, the most expensive player, would set you back 13m, leaving you with only 72m for the remaining 10 slots in your squad. Your job is to build a dream-team of players from football's rich past while staying under budget. You will have to make sacrifices in your squad, but each of these players is a legend for a reason, so it shouldn't hurt too much.

This is a nostalgia-driven single-page application built with React JS. The express purpose of *Legends XI* was twofold:
* To take a stroll down memory lane. In years past, I was able to play FIFA without feeling the compulsion to throw my controller at the TV. Simpler times.
* To learn React and put my knowledge of it to the test. What better way to learn in this hyper-speed world of technology than to get right into the nitty gritty.

This project was built with the following languages, tools, and libraries:
1. Python for web-scraping data off of [FifaIndex.com](https://www.fifaindex.com/players/fifa05_1/?order_by=overallrating&order=0).
2. Postgresql and pgAdmin for database management. In a rush for time, I switched this to JSON for more straightforward integration with the front-end. If I could go back and do it again, this would be one area of prioritization.
3. HTML, CSS, and React for building out the GUI.
4. Git for version control.
